CEBD 1160 Final Project


   For my dataset, i chose to work with NFL data ,specifically NFL combine data from 1999-2015. The dataset 
is in csv form.  
   I then decided to choose 2 columns or categories that when plotted against each other could or should show
some correlation. Therefore i chose the weight of the players, and the fourty yard dash times(speed) of the 
players.  I created a histogram for each in gnuplot , showing the frequency of each. the distribution for each
weight and speed of each was a normal distribution, meaning the mean of each was near the middle of the 
histogram.  When plotted against each other in a scatterplot, we can see the speed increases as the weight 
decreases which is what would be expected although there are some exceptions(outliers).
   I recreated them in R, which turned out to be much easier and straightforward. 
  Overall, although i know we touched lightly on a number of things, i feel that my knowledge in data science 
has grown very fast. Not only in data science but my knowledge of linux command line , github and docker will
prove to be helpful resources as i continue my computer science career.  I am looking forward to the next 
course in data tech.  Thanks...
